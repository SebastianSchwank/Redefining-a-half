# Redefining-a-half
This is an algorythmic way to define the mean by random sampling so
These are onehundred and twentyeight (1024) random Divisions with 128 Iterations starting from 0.0-1.0 and converges against the a 
mean:= (upper+lower)/2 by the code of main.cpp, in the first case it the result is always 0.5 modifie upper and lower to proof this algorythm works for every number.
